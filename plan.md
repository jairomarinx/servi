# Servi  
Unified Plan and Vision

## Vision  
Servi aims to become a simple and trustworthy marketplace where anyone can offer local services and anyone can hire them easily.  
The platform focuses on real world jobs that people need every day, giving visibility to independent providers and reducing friction for customers.

## Long Term Direction  
* Become the preferred place to find local services in cities with low digitalization  
* Allow providers to fully manage their portfolios, pricing and availability  
* Build trust through clear profiles, ratings and transparent interactions  
* Keep the platform lightweight and easy to use  
* Expand to a mobile app when the core is stable  
* Add layers of verification and reputation once the user base grows  

## Problem we address  
* Many service providers work outside digital platforms  
* Customers struggle to find reliable help quickly  
* Urgent services often have no organized channels  
* Cities with high talent but low digitalization have no marketplace  
Servi solves this by offering a clean entry point for both sides.

## Core Principles  
* Simplicity above everything  
* Low friction for both customers and providers  
* Focus on real and common needs  
* Clear communication  
* No unnecessary complexity  

## Future Opportunities  
* Mobile app with geolocation  
* Advanced reputation and verification  
* Integrated payments  
* Premium plans for professionals  
* Smart recommendations based on past activity
